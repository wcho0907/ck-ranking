Well, sort of, but not really.\r\n\r\nLike <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>, Ethereum is a distributed public blockchain network. Although there are some significant technical differences between the two, the most important distinction to note is that Bitcoin and Ethereum differ substantially in purpose and capability. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> offers one particular application of blockchain technology, a peer to peer electronic cash system that enables online <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> payments. While the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> blockchain is used to track ownership of digital currency (<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">bitcoins</a>), the Ethereum blockchain focuses on running the programming code of any decentralized application.\r\n\r\nIn the Ethereum blockchain, instead of mining for bitcoin, miners work to earn Ether, a type of crypto token that fuels the network. Beyond a tradeable cryptocurrency, Ether is also used by application developers to pay for transaction fees and services on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nWhat is a smart contract?\r\nSmart contract is just a phrase used to describe computer code that can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met. Because smart contracts run on the blockchain, they run exactly as programmed without any possibility of censorship, downtime, fraud or third party interference.\r\n\r\nWhile all blockchains have the ability to process code, most are severely limited. Ethereum is different. Rather than giving a set of limited operations, Ethereum allows developers to create whatever operations they want. This means developers can build thousands of different applications that go way beyond anything we have seen before.\r\n\r\nEthereum Wallets\r\nEthereum wallets are fairly simple to set up with multiple popular choices such as myetherwallet, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/complete-beginners-guide-to-metamask?locale=en\">metamask</a>, and even <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/trezor-model-t-wallet-review\">Trezor</a>.
